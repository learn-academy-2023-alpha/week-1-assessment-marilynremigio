# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control software and GitHub is the forum for all developers to push and pull code.

Researched answer: 
Git is a free and public software used for working on a contributed code base. GitHub is the platform that coders can use for storing, tracking, and collaborating on projects.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Logical AND &&, OR ||, loose equals ==, strictly equals ===, and bang or negating operator !

Researched answer: Equality, relational, and logical operators will return a Boolean value such as loose == or strict === equal signs, <,>,<=,>=, || logical OR, && AND, and !

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is a location of a value. The difference between index and value is that a value can be found at an index and the index explains where the value is located.

Researched answer: The index accounts for the position of a character in a string or the placement of data in an array. Indexing starts at 0 when counting placement of values.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays and strings are similar in that the data has values that can be counted starting at 0. The position of each value in an array or a string is called an index. They are different in its syntax that arrays are contained in [] and strings are contained inside " ". There can be an array of multiple strings, but not a string of arrays.

Researched answer: An array is a sequence collection of like data elements and a string is a sequence of characters. Arrays are mostly similar to strings except an array has a fixed length whereas strings can have a variable number of elements.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In proper pair programming, there are two roles: the driver and the navigator. The driver shares the screen of their local and allows the navigator to take lead in formulating the code. The driver is hands-on the keyboard typing, while the navigator double-checks their work and ensures accurate syntax is being typed. The driver and navigator practices clear communication skills to work through blockers and produce working code.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique where two people collaborate on the same work station for a block of code. It was created to make tackling a problem simplier. There is a Driver, who physically types the code and a Navigator who processes and guides the driver. The pairs decide when to take breaks and switch roles during the process.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A built-in method where the function takes in a function as parameters. They are commonly on arrays and for iterations.

2. Jest: A testing structure for JavaScript to make sure that the codes are running properly. It contains a group of files called dependencies, which work together to run and test code.

3. Objects: A group of paired values contained within { } referred as a key. Objects can contain functions as well.

4. Method: Occurs when a function is assigned within an object. Methods can create a variable accessing data within the object.

5. Classes: They map out objects with its own scope of data and behaviors. Names of classes have a different syntax, with the first letter uppercase and following camelCase formula, which is called PascalCased.
